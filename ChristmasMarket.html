<h3>1. Cologne, Germany</h3>
  <h5>Dates: November to December</h5>
  <h5>Best for: a variety of markets</h5>
  <p>Long-favoured as a festive destination, Cologne has several Christmas markets, the largest of which is in the city centre, beneath the cathedral. Markt der Engel offers some of the most magical moments, with hundreds of twinkling lights suspended overhead like stars, and angels flitting between elaborately decorated gables. Nikolausdorf (Saint Nicholas’s village) is aimed at kids, and tells the story of the real St Nick, with the 13th-century Hahnen gate looming majestically in the background. There are even markets dedicated to mythical gnomes, and to maritime history, complete with sea shanties and pirates. If you fancy something a little more traditional, put your skates on and head to the outdoor ice-skating rink on Heumarkt.</p>

<h3>2. Riga, Latvia</h3>
  <h5>Dates: 27th November 22 to 1st January 23</h5>
  <h5>Best for: a magical experience in an old town</h5>
  <p>In Doma laukums (Dome Square), you’ll find Riga’s best known Christmas market: the Old Riga Christmas Market, which is home to an enchanting ensemble of wooden huts, glittering lights, and a large central tree. This is probably the best Christmas Market to visit if you’re looking for the most typical ‘European Christmas Market’ experience, browsing through a maze of stalls while sipping on tasty mulled wine.</p>
